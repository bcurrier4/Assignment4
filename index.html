	<span>This piece was created with different colored sharpies. After laying out the design, I laid down little pieces of felt to create an image. This piece is super important to me because I used it for a final for my drawing 1 class. I learned about patience while creating this piece.</span>

	<div class="art">
	<img src="images/art-2.jpg" width="100%">
	<span>This piece was created using stencils of a mini frying pan. I had different views of the frying pan and I did different patterns on the sketches. I focused on using whites against blacks to create contrast.</span>
